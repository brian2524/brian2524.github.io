## Project description

A sample website I built from my Human-Computer Interaction class using the Ruby On Rails tutorial "THE RUBY ON RAILS TUTORIAL, 6TH ED." by Michael Hartl. It is built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with Ruby on Rails. It features a sigup/loggin system that interacts with a database to store users. Users can also update their profile by visiting the "Update your profile" page (Fig 4). Here they can change any information associated with their account as well as set a profile picture. The user can also discover people who are already registered on this website by visiting the "All Users" page (Fig 5).
